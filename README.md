# Venky's Dumps

This repository contains only Java programs. Most of the programs are written when I was a noobie, trying to figure out what Java actually was. It contains approximately 450+ Java files, some of which might be repeated. 

Please don't blame me for any code malpractice because it was me 2 years ago. Although, I suppose that it will be exciting for you to go through some of my code as it really will help you learn a little bit of what problem solving actually is.

> If you wish to fork this repository and make some changes, do raise a PR and I'll review and merge it if there's no error in it.
